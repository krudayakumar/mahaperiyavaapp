<h1>About Peetam</h1>

More than 2500 years ago, an avalanche of heretic and
non-Vedic
sects, with horrible religious practices threatened to wipe away the ancient Veda-Dharma. In
the Bhagavad Geeta, Lord Krishna has told Arjuna that, whenever there arises danger to
Dharma, He (Krishna) will incarnate in this world to eradicate adharma and re-establish
Dharma. In consonance with his words, the Lord has made partial incarnations during the
course of the present Kali Age. And such an incarnation is the partial incarnation of Siva
as Sankara Bhagavatpada, which happened some twenty-five centuries ago, on the prayer of
celestials to Lord Siva to redeem Bharata-desa from the clutches of non-Vedic heretic sects.
Several sources of authentic information lead to the conclusion that Sri Adi Sankara was
born at Kaladi on the fifth day of the bright fortnight of the Vaisaka month of the cyclic
year Nandana in cyclic year Nandana - Kali 2593 corresponding to 509 B.C.

<p>
    Sri Sankara Bhagavadpadacharya was one of the greatest philosophers and spiritualists of the
    world. He was a discerning dialectician, a consummate commentator and celebrated poet. His
    miraculous achievements, within a short span of life of thirty-two years, speak of his
    super-human aspect. Sages and scholars, who have shone through the centuries after his time,
    have regarded Him as an incarnation of the Divine. Many a thinker and many a scholar of
    different climes and times has been attracted by the philosophic discipline of Advaita
    (Monism) effectively propagated by Sankara. Even modern thinkers and scholars have paid
    eulogistic tributes to Sankara's genius.
</p>
<p>
    Sankara's yatra to Kailasa, the abode of Lord Siva, is one of the most notable events in the
    history of the Acharya. During the course of his peregrination in the Himalayan region,
    Sankaracharya desired to have darshan of Sri Paramesvara having his abode in Kailas. Sankara
    managed to reach Kailas quickly because of His yogic power. He had darshan of Lord
    Paramesvara and Devi Parvati. According to tradition, Sankara adored Paramesvara by singing
    two hymns, known as "Sivapadadi-kesanta stotram" and "Sivakesadi-padanta stotram". Immensely
    pleased with Sankara's prayers, Paramesvara blessed Sankara, presented him with five
    sphatika (crystal) lingas and instructed him to arrange for the worship of the lingas for
    the sake of the welfare of the universe, indicating also the mode of worship. Paramesvara
    also handed over to Sankara the palm-leaf manuscript of Soundarya Lahari, which is noted as
    Siva's own hymn in praise of the Parasakti.
</p>
<p>
    From available biographical information, it is learnt that Sankaracharya placed one of the
    five sphatika lingas got at Kailas and kept the Yoga Linga for his own personal worship and
    that of his successors at Kanchi.
</p>
<p>
    Bhagavatpada Sankara got Kanchi city remodeled and also caused the reconstruction of the
    three principal temples of Kanchi, viz., the temples of Sri Ekamranatha, Devi Kamakshi and
    Sri Varadaraja with the assistance of Rajasena, ruler of Kanchi. Sankara consecrated the
    Srichakra before Devi Kamakshi and thereby secured Her bounteous grace for devotees having
    Her darshan.
</p>
<p>
    A significant event in the history of Sankaracharya is his occupying the Sarvajnapeetha -
    the Throne of Omniscience at Kanchi. A great ascetic one of the early Acharyas of the Kanchi
    Sankaracharya Math - by name Jnanottama - has written a commentary entitled "Chandrika", on
    Sureswaracharya's "Naishkarmyasiddhi". The second sloka (at the end of the commentary)
    alludes to the author of the Chandrika as the glory of the Sarvajnasrama by which term we
    have to understand the Sarvajna Pitha or the Pontifical seat the Advaita Matha in
    Kancheepuram.
</p>
<p>
    Sankara Bhagavapadacharya retired to Kanchi, the Southern Mokshapuri, towards the end of his
    earthly career and shook off his mortal coils in that sacred city. A number of works state
    these facts. Verse 46 of the sixteenth chapter of the ninth section of the voluminous
    Sanskrit work "Sivarahasya" (in the printed Canareese edition No. 32), Jayachamarajendra
    Series of the Mysore Palace, refers to Sankaracharya's worship of the Yoga, Bhoga, Vara,
    Mukti and Moksha lingas, to his success over scholars of other faiths and to his attaining
    siddhi (eternal bliss) at his own ashrama in Kanchi.
</p>
<p>
    Markandeya Samhita, an ancient puranic treatise, consists of 100 khandas, each having
    sub-sections called parispandas, Sub-section 7 and 8 of the 72nd khanda of this work narrate
    briefly the history of Sankara. "Sankaracaritam". A verse, in the seventh parispanda of the
    72nd khanda of this work, relates that the Mahatma Sankara, attained the cit-svarupa, i.e.
    attained eternal bliss at Kanchi, after having consecrated Kamakshi.
</p>
<p>
    Anantanandagiri's biography of Sankara (12th century A.D.) - all versions printed and
    manuscripts, including the Madras University edition - says "The World Preceptor (Sankara)
    desiring to leave for his own abode, sitting once in the Moskhapuri of Kanchi, absorbed his
    gross body into the subtle one and getting reduced into the size of a thumb, attained
    eternal bliss and remains as the all-pervading "Cit" to this day".
</p>
<p>
    Coming to modern times, there is quite a large number of works, in different languages,
    written by erudite scholars mentioning Kanchi as the last resort of Sankara.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from all the citations made above, it needs mention that, in the Srimukha-Birudavali
    (the string of honorific epithets) of the Sankaracharya Math at Kanchi (existing without
    change from very ancient times), the following epithet is found:
</p>
<p>
    "Srimacchankara Bhagavatpadacharyanam adhisthane Simhasanabhishiktanam"
</p>
<p>
    The word "adhisthane" points to Sankara's siddhi at Kanchi.
</p>
<p>
    It may be noted that the name of Sri Sankaracharya is found only in the official seal of
    Kanchi Kamakoti Matha. The word "Kanci-divya kshetre and the phrase
    "Srimacchankara-Bhagavatpadacaryanam adhisthane" in the birudavali indicate Sankara's siddhi
    at Kanchi.
</p>
<p>
    Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada was not merely a great philosopher and preceptor, but an adept in
    organising and a conspicuous national integrator of a very early period of India's history.
    For safeguarding the Veda-Dharma and restoring it to its pristine glory and for propagating
    the Advaita discipline, the Great Acharya established monastic institutions at many of the
    sacred and important places of the country that he had visited during his digvijaya-yatra..
</p>
<p>
    From Anantanandagiri (1119 - 1199 A.D.) whose work is the earliest biography of Sankara,
    down to Mahamahopadhyaya Lakshmana Suri (Author of "Bhagavatpadabhyudayam" - 1917) of the
    last century, a number of reputed historians, distinguished scholars and researchers have
    candidly stated, in their works, that the Great Sankara established monastic institutions
    (mathas) at many an important and sacred places that he visited, during his digvijaya tours.
</p>
<p>
    Guhya-Sahasranama (Sanskrit) refers to five Sankaracharya Peethas (Maths), -Kamakoti Peetha
    as presided over by Sankara himself, to four disciples, Suresvara, Padmapada, Totaka and
    Hastamalaka, to the places of the four other peethas and to five Sphatika lingas.
</p>
<p>
    It may be interesting to read about a Sankara Math at the sacred city of Kasi. This is known
    as Sumeru Math and as Paduka Math. It is presided over by an Advaita Dandi Sanyasi. In some
    authentic works, only one monastic institution is spoken of. In the Sankaracharya Charita by
    Govindanatha, and the Sankarabhydaya of Rajachudamani Deekshita, there is no mention about
    any Matha or Peetha except the Sarvagna Peetha at Kanchi.
</p>
<p>
    Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada settled down at Kancheepuram (Kanchi) at the end of his
    peregrinations and spent the evening years of his life in the Math at Kanchi, established on
    Vaisakha Sukla Purnima of the year Sidharthi - Kali 2620 (482 B.C.) He initiated a very
    young boy into the ascetic order, nominated him as his successor in his Kanchi Matha, and
    placed him under the care of Sri Suresvara, the most aged and the most erudite of His
    disciples. Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada attained Videha mukti in his 32nd year - Cyclic year
    Raktakshi, Adhika Rishabha Maasa, Sukla Ekadasi - Kali 2625 (477 B.C.)
