<h1>The 68th Pontiff His Holiness Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swamigal</h1>
<h2>Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swamigal</h2>
Sri Swaminathan (born at Villupuram on 20th May 1894 -Anuradha Star) was taken to Kalavai in his
13th year, when he was studying at Tindivanam, to be initiated into ascetic order and ordained as
the 68th Acharya of the Kanchi Kamakoti Math. He was given the Sanyasa name Sri Chandrasekharendra
Saraswati. He was affectionately called "Mahaswamigal" and "Walking God". He adorned the Peetam
from February 13, 1907. True to the tradition of the Peetam set by Adi Sankara, Mahaswamigal
travelled throughout the country by foot or by the traditional palanquin. He also stood by the
national sentiments in discarding "foreign cloth" (He immersed them in water instead of setting
fire) and started wearing Khadi. He set the trend to create Trusts for achieving the objectives of
the Peetham. His foremost concern was preservation of the Vedas, tradition and dharma. He advocated
simplicity, shunned pomp, ostentation and extravagance. His exposition of Vedanta, sastras and the
dharmic duties attracted scholars and laymen alike, from far and wide, for it has always been rich
in values and simple in understanding. Great humorist he had the keen acumen to relate root words of
all the languages to Sanskrit highlighting its greatness. He attained moksha at Kancheepuram on 8th
January 1994 (Dhanur, Krishna Dwadasi) in his Centenary year.

<h1>The 69th Pontiff His Holiness Sri Jayendra Saraswati Swamigal</h1>
<h2>Sri Jayendra Saraswati Swamigal</h2>
Sri Subramaniyam, born on July 18, 1935 at Irulneekki in Thanjavur District had Veda Adyayanam at
Tiruvidaimarudur under the direction of Mahaswamjgal and was initiated into Sanyasa on March 22,
1954 and was declared as successor Acharya and given the Sanyasa name Sri Jayendra Saraswati Sri
Pada. In the footsteps of the Mahaswamigal, He too undertook yatra throughout the country. He
attracted people from every nook and corner. He intensified the activities of the Matam to cover new
social objectives -education, health, employment, temple renovation etc. It is due to His untiring
efforts, Kamakoti Peetam established religious and social institutions in many parts of the country.
Kamakoti Peetam has now become a beehive of socio- religious renaissance. The King of Nepal has
erected an arch "Welcome to the only Hindu Kingdom in the world" at the instance of Sri Jayendra
Saraswati, in 1988. The only Sankaracharya after the Adi Sankara to visit Manasarovar and Kailash is
Sri Jayendra Saraswati Swamigal, in 1998; there He installed the idol of Adi Sankara. He had the
unique distinction in being honoured by both Nepal and Chinese Governments. In known recent history,
He is the only Sankaracharya to visit Dhaka in Bangladesh in June 2000. In honouring His visit, Sri
Dhakeswari Temple named the entrance to the temple as "Sankaracharya Gate". His most notable
contribution yet is the founding of the Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Viswa Mahavidyalaya, a
Deemed University in the name of His Guru.

<h1>The 7Oth Pontiff His Holiness Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati Swamigal</h1>
<h2>Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati Swamigal</h2>
Sri Sankaranarayanan, born on March 18, 1969, Periyapalayam, a village near Arani in Tiruvallore
District, was taken as Acharya to the Peetham as Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati, on 29th May 1983,
while He was studying at Polur. Under the tutelage of His Guru and Parama Guru, the rare fortune for
a Peetathipadi, He also travelled throughout the country including remote places like Megalaya. He
is deeply worried about the worsening moral and ethical values of the youth and the deteriorating
educational standards and vanishing cultural and artistic talents in the country. He has initiated a
number of measures to draw the youth, train them in all these aspects along with modern education.
His keen interest to preserve our ancient literature has brought out many publications through the
Matam in Indian and foreign languages for the benefit of devotees. He has conducted a number of
training centres for youth in the name of Bakti Kendra, Dharma Kendra, Karma Kendra, etc, to
inculcate in them our values and traditions.
